 # Install VirtualBox 
  e.g. from [http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads]. We use the latest version of VirtualBox 4.1.x.
 # Copy the virtual disk
  We provide a virtual disk (named OCC2011.vdi) on a USB stick (about 8 GB size) as base to setup your own VM. Copy it to your local disk for performance reasons.
 # Create your Virtual Machine in VirtualBox
  * New Virtual Machine
  * Name it, e.g. "OCC2011", Operating System is Linux, Version is Ubuntu (32 bit)
  * Use defaults for memory (512 MB),
  * Use existing harddisk, boot from harddisk. Select your copied VirtualDisk file (e.g. OCC2011.vdi)
 # Start your Virtual Machine
  Note: the default user is named "osgi" with standard password "osgi".
 # Customize your Virtual Machine if required
  E.g. when running the VM within an company intranet, you have to specify an Network proxy in Linux. Goto System -> Preferences -> Network Proxy ->
 # Start Eclipse from Desktop
  Note: the SVN is yet included and linked to [http://svn.codespot.com/a/eclipselabs.org/occ/trunk]. The SVN user is "occparticipant@t-online.de", the password will be given at OSGi Code Camp. The password is preset, and will be read from local secure store (use "osgi" as password to get access to store).
